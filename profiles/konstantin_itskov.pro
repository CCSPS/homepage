    "description": "Hello! Ever since I was young I have always been interested in science and technology. At the age of nine my mother bought our first family computer and with it came a whole new world of fascination. After receiving my first computer at the age of nine, I taught myself how to take apart the hard drive and swap the memory cards. By the time I was eleven, I had already upgraded my computer several times by trading parts with other computer-savvy friends. I then attended a specialized high school for computer science and I participated in an after-school IT program. I taught myself everything from C++ and flash action script to matrix and vector mathematics while learning Pascal, Assembler and html at school. At the age of 15, I made my first server-client communication software and started working on a 3-D game engine. My life then took a turn and I was drafted into the military. For a long time I lost touch with computers and recently I found my way back doing something that I once loved.",
